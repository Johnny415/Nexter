# General info
"Nexter" is a third project I have worked on, following along
with Jonas Schmedtmann's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/">Advanced CSS and Sass course.</a>
This project is focused on using <i>CSS grid</i> for overall layout of the page.

<i>CSS grid </i> is a two-dimensional layout system and it workes in a way that applies <i>CSS</i> rules to both parent element (Grid Container) and 
to that element children elements (Grid Items).

## What I've learned?

There are many useful different <i>CSS</i> techniques and methods that are introduced througout this project.

I, perosnaly, found very useful techniques how to build responsive layouts using <i>"minmax"</i> functions in combination
with <i>"auto-fill"</i> and <i>"auto-fit"</i> keywords to achive responsive layouts without writing media queries.

Also, creating complex grid-looking gallery of images is quite easy task with using  <i>"repeat"</i> function for 
creating as many rows and columns as we need and using <i>"object-fit"</i> property on our images so they don't overflow grid cells,as shown on example below.
